# GirlsWhoCodeSIP2018

Girls Who Code is a non-profit organization on a mission to close the gender gap in tech. In the Summer of 2018, I served as Lead Instructor of their Summer Immersion 
Program. Over the course of eight weeks students learned about and explored Scratch, Python, Web Development, Robotics and Data Science.

This repository contains projects we completed during that time. To learn more visit girlswhocode.com
