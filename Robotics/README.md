# Unit 2.1: Robotics

## Table of Contents

### Projects:

1. Let There Be Light: Part 2
    * Students learned how to write an Arduino C program and how to use the commands `pinMode()`, `delay()`, and `digitalWrite()`.
2. Let There Be Light: Part 3
    * Students learned how to use functions and variables in Arduino C.
3. Robot Dance Party
    * Students learned how to read circuit diagrams, declare and call functions in Arduino C, and use loops.
4. Whisker Input Code ALong
    * Students learned how to use an input with the teacher by coding the whisker sensor.
5. Build a Circuit
    * Students learned how to plug in and code an input using just the circuit diagram.
6. Here Kitty Kitty
    * Students got creative with inputs. They used a sensor to move a cat robot forward.
7. Escape Bot
    * Students learned AI development by creating a robot that can escape from a three-sided box.
